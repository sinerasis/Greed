# Greed
## A small extension for Google Chrome / Chromium that gives a small amount of power back to the user.

Current features of this extension include:
- (Google) Prevents URLs in Google web applications from being routed through Google Search.
- (Google / Chrome) Use a simple blank page as the new tab page.
- (Google / Search) Appends site exclusions to Google Search queries automatically.
- (Reddit) Redirect to old.

To Install and use:
- Clone this repository.
- Make any changes you like (optional).
- Open your browser and navigate to the extension settings (Menu > More tools > Extensions).
- Enable developer mode.
- Load unpacked, choose the *directory* you cloned.

The lack of user friendly options is intentional. To make changes or enable/disable features in this extension, use your favorite code editor and edit the files in the extension folder. Remember to reload the extension after making any changes!

My code is not perfect. If  you find a problem or better way of doing something, feel free to submit a pull request.
