# Greed
## A small extension for Google Chrome / Chromium

Current features of this extension include:
- Use a simple blank page as the new tab page.
- Appends site exclusions to Google Search queries automatically.
- Prevents URLs in Google applications from being routed through Google Search.

To Install and use:
- Clone this repository.
- Make any changes you like.
- Open your browser and navigate to the extension settings (Menu > More tools > Extensions).
- Enable developer mode.
- Load unpacked, choose the *directory* you cloned.

The lack of user friendly options is intentional.

My code is not perfect. If  you find a problem or better way of doing something, feel free to submit a pull request.
